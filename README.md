# Infrastructure as Code  
My Collections using Terraform, Ansible, Chef and Linux scripting. Refer to file Issue_log for issue details and resolutions.

# Use Terraform to setup API workload infra in AWS:

 ## Details to set up:

* One VPC
* Two subnets in 2 AZs
* An internet gateway
* One security group for VMs, another one for ALB
* Using existing SSH key pair
* Two EC2 instances, API-AWS-001 on Subnet1, API-AWS-002 on Subnet2
* Deploy the tailered API code written by Node.JS
* ALB associates with the 2 AWS VMs
* Update hosts file for Ansible for ongoing Configuration Management

## Setup Steps:
  * Step 1> [DONE!] create 1 VPC, 2 subnets and Security Group
  
  Refer to Repo:https://github.com/jimmycgz/Tarraform-Slalom-Dojo
  
  More learned from Microsoft Open Source Virutal Conference:

  Refer to this webpage for Route table and IGW: https://040code.github.io/2017/06/18/terraform-aws-vpc/

  
  * Step 2> [DONE!]provision 2 VMs, API-AWS-001 & API-AWS-002, using my own AMI with pre-configured API code.
  
  * Step 3> [DONE!]Run Terraform via Jenkins Pipeline

   Refer to https://github.com/david-wells-1/jenkins-terraform-pipeline
  
  * Step 4> [DONE! Oct 1st] Deploy ALB with API-AWS-001 & API-AWS-002, connect to API3-GCP instance
  
   ** Step 4.1 [DONE! Sep28] Manually installed httpd web service in API3GCP on GCP and connect it with API-AWS-Tool on AWS Tool Server. Used Terraform Remote-exec to automaticaly update the ip address of API3-GCP into the config.json in API-AWS-001 (AWS Subnet1) 

  ** Step 4.2 [DONE! Sep 30] Further refine Terraform code, use count, index, local_exec, local_file, remote_exec with SSH connection, AWS-ALB with multiple AZs (Detailed task items are listed in the top of Terraform.tf)
    
  ** Step 4.3 [DONE! Oct 1st] Have created 3 folders in my own Repo API-DEMO, tailered the code showing corret naming for 3 instances. All new public IPs are updated in a host file for further usage via Ansible.
  
  
 ## Further Steps:
 
 * Further Step > [WIP] Use Ansible for Configuration Management to deploy API web service for API-AWS-001, API-AWS-002 and connect to API3-GCP.
  
 * Further Step > [To Do] try use Terraform template .tpl to update the ip into the config file. or use File provisioner.
    
 * Further Step > [To Do] Run Chef local mode through Terraform
  
  Need to figure out how to use Chef client mode to manage a new node created by Terraform

 * Further Step > [To Do]Deploy to Azure container by Terraform

 # Ansible Script for Configuration Management 
 
 ## Pull/Push Deployment
 
 Assume the file hosts has the updated host ip list from Terraform
  
     sudo ansible-playbook ansible-web.yml --private-key=/home/ubuntu/.ssh/Jmy_Key_AWS_Apr_2018.pem
 
     sudo ansible AWS -a "echo test" --private-key=/home/ubuntu/.ssh/Jmy_Key_AWS_Apr_2018.pem -u ubuntu

 Use -i specifies the ip host file, no need to use -u if already specified the login user name in yml
 
    ansible-playbook -i /usr/local/bin/terraform-inventory playbook.yml --private-key=/home/user/.ssh/aws_user.pem -u ubuntu

    ansible gcp_web_prod -a "sudo reboot"

Reboot each instance via ansible playbook to auto deploy by this script. All instances are pre-configured startup script to pull the latest release code from a registry say AWS S3 bucket or ECR. Such startup script can be configured in Linux CLI: 

     crontab â€“e 


/# can also try to create a tag file using ansible and setup linux task to check this file every 10mins, run deployment and delete this file. 

    sh $HOME/ansi_deploy.sh

# Chef Script
    sudo chef-client --local-mode cookbooks/apache/recipes/server.rb

## Chef Recipe to build hello word web service

    package 'httpd'

    file '/var/www/html/index.html' do

    content 'Hello, world!'
  
    end

    service 'httpd' do

    action [:start, :enable]
  
    end

# Linux Script for Configuration Management
    for host in $(cat hosts.txt); do ssh "$host" "sudo reboot"; done

    #!/usr/bin/env bash

    #Deploy to all pinable Product Web Instance(s) Ubuntu .

    #AWS subnet1 and subnet2 10.0.1.x 10.0.2.x

    #GCP subnet 

    #Azure subnet

    #Generate a hosts.txt file collecting all pinable IP in one Prod subnet

    echo "Generating a hosts.txt file collecting all pinable IPs in one Subnet"

    Note: all instances need to open ICMP port to be able to use ping.

    seq 254 | xargs -iIP -P255 ping -c1 10.0.1.IP |gawk -F'[ :]' '/time=/{print $4}'  >hosts.txt
    seq 254 | xargs -iIP -P255 ping -c1 10.0.2.IP |gawk -F'[ :]' '/time=/{print $4}'  >>hosts.txt

    echo "Run Deploy script file in a loop for all pinable instances"


## Run Push script in Jenkins
    for host in $(cat hosts.txt); do sudo ssh -i /home/ubuntu/.ssh/My_2018.pem ubuntu@$host "sh /home/ubuntu/Deploy_Prod.sh"; done  |true
